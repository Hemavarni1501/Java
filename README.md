JAVA PRACTICE CODES

This repository contains multiple small Java programs for practice.  
Each program is designed to strengthen core concepts in Java such as loops, conditionals, arrays, patterns, OOP, and more.  


📂 Contents  
- ✅ Basic programs (Hello World, arithmetic operations, data type demos)  
- ✅ Conditional statements (leap year, ATM simulation, etc.)  
- ✅ Loops & patterns (square, triangle, right/left patterns)  
- ✅ Arrays & simple problems  
- ✅ Object-Oriented Programming examples  

🚀 How to Run  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hemavarni1501/Java
````

2. Navigate to the folder:

   java FileName
   ```
